`DeepJinnie` is the easiest way to find the answers you seek online. 


**Why is it called DeepJinnie?**

DeepJinnie comes from the word Jinn, which is the non anglicized version of genies. The internet is like a wise genie that holds all answers, but you need to ask your questions precisely and correctly in order to obtain them.
